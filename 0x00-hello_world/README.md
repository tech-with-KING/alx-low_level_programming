# Hello, World 
Projects done during Fullstack Software Engineering at [**Alx School**](https://www.alxafrica.com/).It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in **`C` language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in [`Bash 5.1`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* Tested on [`Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* Language used `C` and compiled using `gcc` compiler

## Files
| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [`0-preprocessor`](0-preprocessor) | runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. |
| [`1-compiler`](1-compiler) | compiles a C file but does not link. |
| [`2-assembler`](2-assembler) | Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file |
| [`3-name`](3-name) | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun` |
| [`4-puts.c`](4-puts.c) | Prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"` |
| [`5-printf.c`](5-printf.c) | Prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art` |
| [`6-size.c`](6-size.c) | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled |
| [`100-intel`](100-intel) | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file |
| [`101-quote.c`](101-quote.c) | Prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19` |
